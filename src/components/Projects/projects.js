        <strong>Description</strong>:
        Joint project between Korg and the Music Technology Group (Universitat Pompeu Fabra).
        The university was responsible of developing an algorithm capable of measuring in real-time how well an
        instrument is being played (for flute, clarinet, trumpet, violin and cello). Then this algorithm was used
        to evaluate instrument sounds on a website. This website also allowed users to give their own ratings on the
        sounds, and this ratings where used to feed a machine learning process to improve the original algorithm
        accuracy.
        Korg's mission was to embed the algorithm in their tuners and a mobile app.
        This project resulted in a mobile app (Cortosia), a hardware tuner, a patent and two publications.
        <br/>
        <strong>My role</strong>: Develop the audio processing algorithm and the machine learning process that
        improved it. For that matter I:<br/>

        • Collected musician ratings for each performance<br/>
        • Extracted audio features from recordings<br/>
        • Created a model for each instrument with the help of machine learning (Weka)<br/>
        • Developed a desktop app to showcase the algorithm<br/>

        Essentia is an open-source C++ library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval.
        It contains an extensive collection of algorithms including audio input/output functionality,
        standard digital signal processing blocks, statistical characterization of data, and a large set of spectral,
        temporal, tonal and high-level music descriptors.
        Essentia is cross-platform and it is designed with a focus on optimization in terms of robustness,
        computational speed and low memory usage, which makes it effective for many industrial applications.
        The library is also wrapped in Python and includes a number of command-line tools and third-party extensions,
        which facilitate its use for fast prototyping and allow setting up research experiments very rapidly.

        Ballantine's promoted a campaign together with the spanish pop-group "La Oreja de Van Gogh" so that people
        could write the lyrics of their new song. For that purpose, a web was created to let people write lyrics
        and hear a realistic result that was generated by synthesizing the singing voice over the background music.
        Finally, the group members chose the winner and recorded a studio version with the singers voice.
        The song is called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xyDIYWR0Qk">Otra vez me has sacado a bailar</a>".
        The singing voice was synthesized using <a href="https://www.vocaloid.com/en/">Vocaloid</a>,
        a technology of Yahama developed with <a href="https://www.voctrolabs.com/">Voctrolabs</a>.

        As a result we modded a cheap light saber controlled by embedding an Arduino to track its movements.
        Position sensors data was sent to a computer which eventually allowed to control different synthesizers by
        moving the saber. We also included a mode to emulate Star Wars sounds, of course.<br/>

        <strong>Title</strong>: Study of reverberation robust pitch estimators for the singing voice<br/>
        <strong>Abstract</strong>: Making machines understand us has been a challenging issue in the later years.
        Although reverberation is an omnipresent phenomenon in our daily lives,
        computers are still not prepared to handle it correctly.
        A study to help machines overcome reverberation when estimating fundamental frequency is presented.
        The study focuses on the singing voice since it is the form of human expression with more complex
        fundamental frequency contours. There have been selected four fundamental frequency estimation
        algorithms (YIN, TWM, SAC, MELODIA) common for this task in dry conditions.
        The study evaluates them following the MIREX Audio Melody Extraction evaluation criteria.
        First, the algorithms are evaluated in dry conditions and different reverberant conditions.
        It is shown how an increasing reverberation time supposes an increasing loss in accuracy for all algorithms.
        Besides, MELODIA exhibits a special robustness compared to its competitors.
        Then, we try to improve fundamental frequency estimators’ performance using different
        de-reverberation methods (NML, NMF, ITD) as preprocessors. Only NML succeeds in such a task for all
        algorithms except MELODIA, which keeps performing the best.
        Anyway, it demonstrates that de-reverberation methods can be used to improve fundamental frequency
        estimators’ results in reverberant conditions. Finally, the insights of the study results are analyzed.
        In order to exemplify how the results of this study can be used to improve algorithms’ accuracy,
        a proof-of-concept algorithm (MIX) is presented. MIX combines MELODIA with SAC and NML dereverberation.
        It has a general improvement in accuracy of 2% in reverberant conditions and, in addition, it performs as
        good as the best algorithms in dry conditions: 91% overall accuracy.<br/>

        <strong>Description</strong>: Brand Monitor is a web application that analyzes different Internet information
        sources in order to know the opinion that users have about brands (companies, products, etc.).
        This is a semi-automated tool: it collects the information from the Internet,
        people is responsible of labelling and classifying this information and, finally,
        it generate a series graphics and conclusions.<br/>
        Since this was a company project, the thesis also deals with agile methodologies and test-driven development
        as innovative processes used during development.<br/>
